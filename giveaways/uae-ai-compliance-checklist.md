# UAE AI Compliance Checklist
## Enterprise AI System Compliance Framework for DIFC, ADGM & Federal UAE

## Executive Summary

This checklist provides a comprehensive compliance framework for enterprises deploying AI systems in the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has three primary regulatory frameworks: Federal UAE (AIATA), DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre), and ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market). Each framework has distinct requirements, and enterprises must comply with the applicable jurisdiction(s) based on their location and operations.

**Critical Note**: NDMO (National Data Management Office) is a **Saudi Arabian** regulatory body under SDAIA, not a UAE entity. UAE enterprises should reference AIATA, DIFC, or ADGM regulations.
