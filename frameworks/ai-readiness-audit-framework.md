# AI Readiness Audit Framework
## Core Consulting Offering for EchoLabs AI

## Executive Summary

The EchoLabs AI Readiness Audit Framework is a comprehensive, UAE-market-tailored assessment methodology designed to evaluate enterprise readiness for LLM/AI agent adoption. Unlike generic maturity models, this framework specifically addresses UAE regulatory requirements (NDMO, DIFC, ADGM), Arabic language considerations, and sector-specific compliance needs. The framework produces a quantitative AI Readiness Score (0-100) with actionable, phase-based recommendations.

**Business Value:**
- Positions EchoLabs as trusted advisor before platform sale
- Creates immediate consulting revenue (USD 15,000-50,000 per audit)
- Generates qualified pipeline for SaaS platform adoption
- Differentiates from vendor-biased consultants
- Establishes credibility with C-level decision makers
